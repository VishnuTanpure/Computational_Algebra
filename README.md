# Ideal Poset of Quotient Polynomial Rings

## Overview

This project involves computing the ideal poset of a quotient polynomial ring. The code explores various algebraic structures and properties, including the generation and classification of ideals within these rings. It utilizes Python libraries such as SymPy and NumPy to handle symbolic computation and numerical operations, and Matplotlib to visualize the poset of ideals.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a series of Jupyter notebook cells, each performing specific tasks to compute and visualize the ideal poset. Below is a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. **Quotient Ring Definition**: Defines the quotient ring \( R/I \) where \( I \) is an ideal in a polynomial ring \( R \).

2. **Non-Units Calculation**: Identifies non-units in the quotient ring \( R/I \).

3. **Associate Classes**: Computes and organizes the associated classes of \( R \).

4. **Generators of Ideals**: Determines the generators of the ideals within the quotient ring.

5. **Principal Ideals**: Calculates principal ideals and their properties.

6. **Two-Generated Ideals**: Examines ideals generated by two elements and their properties.

7. **All Ideals**: Computes all possible ideals and classifies them based on cardinality and generation.

8. **Poset Construction**: Constructs the partially ordered set (poset) of ideals based on inclusion relationships.

9. **Visualization**: Visualizes the poset of ideals using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `sympy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy sympy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Import the required libraries and define the polynomial ring, quotient ring, and ideal.

2. **Run Cells**: Execute each cell in sequence to compute and analyze various properties of the quotient ring and its ideals.

3. **Visualization**: The final cell generates a plot of the ideal poset, illustrating the relationships between different ideals.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Quotient Ring Definition

```python
# Define the quotient ring and its generators.
```

This cell defines the quotient ring \( R/I \) and calculates its various properties, including the generators of ideals.

### 2. Non-Units Calculation

```python
# Identify non-units in the quotient ring.
```

This cell determines which elements are non-units in the quotient ring by checking for zero divisors.

### 3. Associate Classes

```python
# Compute and organize the associated classes of R.
```

This step involves computing and organizing the associated classes of the ring \( R \) based on the non-units.

### 4. Generators of Ideals

```python
# Determine the generators of the ideals within the quotient ring.
```

Calculates the generators of ideals and their properties.

### 5. Principal Ideals

```python
# Calculate principal ideals and their properties.
```

Computes all principal ideals and checks their properties.

### 6. Two-Generated Ideals

```python
# Examine ideals generated by two elements.
```

Finds and analyzes ideals that can be generated by two elements.

### 7. All Ideals

```python
# Compute and classify all possible ideals.
```

This cell computes and classifies all possible ideals based on their cardinality and generation.

### 8. Poset Construction

```python
# Construct the poset of ideals.
```

Constructs the partially ordered set (poset) of ideals based on inclusion relationships.

### 9. Visualization

```python
# Visualize the poset of ideals using Matplotlib.
```

Generates a visualization of the ideal poset, illustrating the relationships between different ideals.
